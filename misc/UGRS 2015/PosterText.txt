  BAH! Formal Logic is... Boring, Abstract, Hard
  Boring:
  Learning formal logic can be dry and boring for students. It often seems to students
  that it lacks any practical implications or meaning and is only a sequence of symbol
  manipulation.

  Abstract:
  There lies a gap between the abstract symbols of logic and the meaningful
  problems that they represent. The link between formal logic symbols and what
  they represent difficult to comprehend for many students beginning logic.

  Hard:
  Logic can be a difficult concept to master. It can be especially challenging
  to visualize the flow of an argument in a long formal logic proof, which can
  make learning formal logic very discouraging for students.

**I forgot if I was supposed to change anything with this...**
Objective:
The objective of the LEGUP project is to create an easy to use graphical
interface that will facilitate learning of logical reasoning by using grid-
based puzzles. LEGUP could be used while teaching courses in formal logic
to make the concepts more approachable for students and increase their
understanding of the subject.

  First Picture (in progress sudoku proof):
  LEGUP uses grid-based puzzles to convey the principle concepts of logic
  into recognizable and entertaining games such as Sudoku, Nurikabe,
  Battleship, and others.

  Second Picture (Different types of rules):
  Students have a number of options when proving these puzzles: "basic rules"
  that are based on axioms of formal logic relating to puzzle moves, a proof
  by cases where the proof is split into a set of all possibilities for a grid
  location, and proof by contradiction which would eliminate impossible cases.

  Third Picture (proof tree):
  LEGUP shows both the puzzle grid and a graphical proof tree that can
  give the user feedback on if their proof is correct or not. The degree of
  feedback given can be modified to alter difficulty and enhance learning.

  Solution:
  LEGUP is Engaging, Concrete, Easy to Use

  Engaging:
  Grid-based puzzles like those employed in LEGUP build upon basic logic skills
  and can make learning formal logic a more interesting and entertaining game
  for students.

  Concrete:
  By using puzzles, we give students a clear representation of the formal logic
  they use. Additionally, students can see that despite having different puzzles
  in LEGUP the same logical principles can be used to solve each one.

  Easy to Use:
  The visual, grid-based puzzles in LEGUP can help make formal logic more
  approachable and easier to understand. The corresponding graphical proof
  tree also makes it easier to visualize the flow of the proof.

Significance:
  Despite its vast importance across disciplines and society, no one possesses
  the power of perfect reasoning. It is for this reason that logic classes are
  taught. However, traditional formal logic instruction relies heavily on proofs
  that appear only as symbol manipulation. Rather than actually grasping the
  true purpose and meaning of logic, students only learn how to manipulate symbols
  using a given set of rules in order to reach a given goal. This is very similar
  to the "Chinese Room" argument proposed by John Searle; in which he adamantly
  argues that this form of symbol manipulation is not intelligence at all.
  Students learning in this traditional way may grasp the concepts within
  whichever physical logic system they are currently using, but will
  fail to apply that logic to any other domain where logical reasoning will by helpful.
  LEGUP, on the other hand, shows students that logic is not simply manipulating Ps and Qs
  with truth tables and quantifiers, but rather a strong principle with an underlying
  abstract nature that can be applied across all domains. This realization will
  lead to a "deep" understanding of logical reasoning that can help students in
  areas far beyond their assignments in a single logic course.
