BAH! Logic is... Boring, Abstract, Hard
Boring:
Learning logic can be dry and boring for students. However, grid-based
puzzles that build upon basic logic skills can make learning logic a
fun, interesting and entertaining game for students.

Abstract:
There lies a gap between the abstract symbols of logic and the meaningful
problems that they represent. Presenting logic to students without
these abstract symbols allows them to better understand its meaning and
goals.

Hard:
Logic can be a difficult concept to master. The visual, grid-based puzzles
in LEGUP can help make formal logic more approachable and easier to
understand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
The objective of the LEGUP project is to create an easy to use graphical
interface that will facilitate education of formal logic by using grid-
based puzzles. LEGUP could be used while teaching courses in formal logic
to make the concepts more approachable for students and increase their
understanding of the subject.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Methods:
LEGUP uses grid-based puzzles to convey the principle concepts of logic
into recognizable and entertaining games such as Sudoku, Nurikabe,
Battleship, and others. Students find proofs to each puzzle by applying
various "basic rules" that are based on axioms of formal logic.
Additionally, students can also perform a proof by cases, where the proof
is split into a set of possible moves and the student continues with
each case until either they either solve the puzzle, reach a
contradiction, or merge two or more cases to get closer to a solution.
LEGUP shows both the puzzle grid and a graphical proof tree that can
give the user feedback on if their proof is correct or not.
