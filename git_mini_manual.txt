remote - location where repository is stored
	ex) "origin" is github for LEGUP repository

git add <filename> //adds a file to the staging area for the next commit
git commit -m "some message" //appends changes since last commit to LOCAL history tree (you must also push to github)
git push origin <branch_name> //pushes the local history to the specified branch on the remote named origin (github), you must commit first
git pull //gets most recent changes from github on the current branch
git checkout <branch_name> //changes branch, make sure it is a branch name, not a file name
git status //shows how many commits ahead/behind of the origin your local repository is and shows what filenames have been modified since last commit
git branch //lists branches
git branch <new_branch_name> //creates a new branch
git log //displays a list of commits
